# Library Database Project

This project is a collaborative effort to design and build a real-world **database-driven application** for managing the operations of a public library.

The goal is to create a system that supports:
- Managing physical and digital library items
- Tracking borrow/return activity and fines
- Hosting community events
- Supporting donations and wishlist suggestions
- Handling librarian assistance and help requests
- Organizing user roles (patrons, staff, volunteers)

---

## Project Overview

The library will manage a wide collection of materials such as:
- Books
- Magazines
- Scientific journals
- CDs
- Records

For each item, the database will store:
- Title
- Format (e.g., print or digital)
- Type (e.g., book, CD)
- Availability status

## System Features

- Add new items to the library
- Track current availability
- Accept donated items (with approval status)

### Borrowing and Fines

### Event Management

- Track target audience (e.g., kids, adults, seniors)
- Allow people to register and attend events

### User and Staff Roles
- Track all users: patrons, volunteers, staff
- Allow users to submit help requests
- Allow librarians to respond and resolve requests
